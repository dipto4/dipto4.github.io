## About me

I am a computational astrophysicist purusing my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my B.S. in Physics from Allegheny College in 2019.

I have worked in a variety of projects at various scales - solar system dynamics, stellar dynamics in young massive clusters and combining hydrodynamics with gravitational dyanmics for clusters. I am also interested in pursuing topics in cosmology and intermediate mass black hole formation.

I specialize in gravitational dynamics and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. I am currently working on my own code that combines gravitational dynamics and SPH to treat interactions of stars in clusters. I have advanced knowledge of Fortran, C, Python and CUDA.  

On the computer science side of things, I am interested in High Performance Computing, GPU computing, and machine learning.

## Experience

* **Los Alamos National Lab (May 2018 -- August 2018)** - Optimization of an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian code called FleCSALE for the triple point problem. Researched MPI+X hybrid programming techniques. Used CUDA to port various high order interpolation algorithms used by EOSPAC to GPUs. Explored the usage of machine learning to replace interpolation calls to EOSPAC. Presented a poster at Supercomputing 2018 and a talk at CCS division of LANL.

* **Leiden University (May 2017 -- present)** - Exploring the secular evolution of the solar system and its debris disk in the birth cluster. Worked with different high order integrators (symplectic and non-symplectic) and investigated coupling of astrophysical codes using Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Presented a poster at APS April, 2018 and a talk at DPS 2018. A paper is being written.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
