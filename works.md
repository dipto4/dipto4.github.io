## Research

* **Carnegie Mellon University (August 2019 -- present)** - My work involves using novel force calculation techniques like the fast multipole method for the *N*-body problem. Our FMM based code, *Taichi*, has been used to simulate dense stellar systems such as nuclear star clusters and how they affect the mergers of massive black holes. I am primarily working on simulations of sources of low-frequency Gravitational Waves (GW) like massive black hole binaries but have also worked on other projects that include capture of interstellar objects and examining the effect of dark matter spikes on GWs as a method to detect dark matter. 

* **Los Alamos National Lab (May 2018 -- August 2018)** - I was a co-design summer school student where I worked on optimization of an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian code called FleCSALE for the triple point problem. Along with my colleagues, I researched MPI+X hybrid programming techniques. Additionally, I used CUDA to port various high order interpolation algorithms used by EOSPAC to GPUs. I also explored the usage of machine learning to replace interpolation calls to EOSPAC. 

* **Leiden University (May 2017 -- August 2018)** - As a LEAPS student, I was researching the secular evolution of the solar system and its debris disk in the birth cluster. I worked with different high order integrators (symplectic and non-symplectic) and investigated coupling of astrophysical codes using Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE).
